# Speed Challenge

this file is called v2 because github wasn't cooperating with updating the page online so i took a roudabout method of getting it to update

During the lab in week 7 we had a speed challenge and this report is emant to record each step for the speed challenge.

## Step 1

Log into ieng6

this only requires 1 `<up>` input
this command only happened to be 1 up in the search hisotry so it was quick to access

this command simply logs me into ieng6

## Step 2 

clone the forked repository to your account

this required 10 `<up>` inputs for me, as it was pretty far up the search history

this command clones the forked repository to my ieng6 account

## Step 3

Run the tests inside the folder and show the test fails

this required seventeeen and sixteen `<up>` inputs for both commands, pretty brutal

Both of these commands, the java and javac commands with link to the libraries for junit and hamcrest, compile and run the tests for ListExamples and TestList Examples

## Step 4 

edit the code to make the test pass

we use nano ListExamples.java, then the next series of inputs to edit the line that fails by pressing `<down>` 42 times, `<right>` 12 times, pressing `<backspace>` once, presing "2", then pressing `<crtl+0>`, `<enter>`, then `<ctrl+x>`

using `nano` we are able to edit the file from the command line and save the changes to the file

## Step 5

after running the tests again, we can show it now succeeds

since we ran other commands previously, the commands we used in step 5 are now 18 and 17 `<up>` inputs in the search hisotry

## Step 6

And finally we add and commit this to our fork

These commands were only 9 and 7 `<up>` inputs in the search history

these commands add the file changes to the list of things ready to commit to the repository on github, and then commits it with the meassage "fixed"
